Please  Am writing this for the python reading file 


                                   Reading file 

                                   'r' mode is used to read only the file.
                                   'r+' mode is used to read and write the file.
                                   'w' mode is used to write to the file.
                    'w+' mode is used to read and write the file, but it will overwrite the file if it exists.
                                      'a' mode is used to append to the file.
                                      'a+' mode is used to read and append to the file.
                                      'x' mode is used to create a new file, if it already exists it will raise an error.
                                      'b' mode is used to read or write binary files.
                                      't' mode is used to read or write text files (default).
Reading Files in Python: Complete Guide
Python provides several ways to read files, each suited for different scenarios. Here's a comprehensive guide with examples for various file reading operations.

1. Basic File Reading Methods
A. Read Entire File at Once
with open('data.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()  # Returns entire content as string
print(content)

B. Read Line by Line
python
with open('data.txt', 'r') as file:
    for line in file:  # Memory-efficient for large files
        print(line.strip())  # strip() removes newline characters
C. Read All Lines into List
python
with open('data.txt', 'r') as file:
    lines = file.readlines()  # Returns list of lines
print(lines)
2. Advanced File Reading Techniques
A. Reading Specific Chunks
python
chunk_size = 1024  # 1KB at a time
with open('large_file.bin', 'rb') as file:
    while True:
        chunk = file.read(chunk_size)
        if not chunk:
            break
        process(chunk)  # Your processing function
B. Using seek() to Navigate
python
with open('data.txt', 'r') as file:
    file.seek(10)  # Move to 10th byte position
    print(file.read(5))  # Read next 5 characters
C. Reading CSV Files
python
import csv

with open('data.csv', 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)  # Each row is a list of values
3. Real-World Examples
A. Config File Parser
python
config = {}
with open('config.ini', 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        if '=' in line:
            key, value = line.strip().split('=', 1)
            config[key] = value
print(config)
B. Log File Analyzer
python
error_count = 0
with open('app.log', 'r') as log_file:
    for line in log_file:
        if 'ERROR' in line:
            error_count += 1
print(f"Total errors: {error_count}")
C. Binary File Processing
python
with open('image.jpg', 'rb') as img_file:
    header = img_file.read(100)  # Read first 100 bytes
    print(header.hex())  # Display as hexadecimal
4. Best Practices
Always use context managers (with statements) for automatic file closing

Specify encoding when working with text files:

python
with open('data.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
Handle exceptions:

python
try:
    with open('data.txt', 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found")
except IOError:
    print("Error reading file")
Use generators for large files:

python
def read_large_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            yield line.strip()
